      "biography": "A struggling conceptual artist in his late 20s, deeply empathetic but often misunderstood. He has a strained and complex relationship with his father, Arthur. Elias is not a criminal by nature, but is driven by a profound, almost desperate, need for emotional truth and validation regarding his past, particularly concerning a suppressed childhood trauma.",
      "statedAlibi": "Attending a remote, 'off-grid' artist's retreat upstate. Confirmed by pre-arranged check-ins with fellow artists and social media posts (pre-scheduled to appear organic). Maintained a 'no-signal' narrative for his phone during the critical window.",
      "alibiFlaw": "Fellow artists at the retreat, particularly Ben Carter (C06), might recall Elias making or receiving calls/texts during the 'no-signal' window, or leaving the retreat earlier than publicly stated. His 'untraceable' travel methods could be exposed by a ride-share driver or friend (CF1, CF2, CF14).",

      "initialStatementToPolice": "When contacted by authorities regarding the missing item from his father's apartment, Elias expressed deep concern for his father's distress, suggesting the incident was 'bizarre' and 'unexplainable.' He subtly mentioned recent news about 'smart home vulnerabilities' and 'ghost in the machine' glitches affecting high-tech residences."

He's currently facing minor gambling debts, which he keeps hidden.",

      "alibiFlaw": "The 'implausible' nature of a 15-20 minute RF glitch in a supposedly 'unbreakable' system is highly suspicious (CF3). His financial difficulties could provide a motive for a staged 'system failure' or even an inside job. Questioning his clients about his remote work might reveal discrepancies.",

She manages his schedule, finances, and often has access to his apartment for various tasks, including overseeing cleaners. Beneath her composed exterior, she harbors a quiet resentment for Arthur's demanding nature and his tendency to take her efforts for granted. She possesses a legitimate key to the penthouse.",

Her online activity logs might not fully corroborate her 'working' claims, or she might have left her residence for a brief period undetected. Her resentment could be a hidden motive.",

She believes strongly in the power of 'artistic statements' and has previously discussed provocative, conceptual art 'interventions' with Elias.",

      "alibiFlaw": "While her physical alibi is strong, her influence on Elias's conceptual thinking and her history of encouraging provocative art (CF13) could make her an accessory or an instigator. She might have provided logistical advice or resources for a 'conceptual' act, even if she wasn't physically present.",
      "trueAction": "Was genuinely at the art fair in Miami, actively promoting her gallery and artists, including Elias's work.",
      "connectionToCase": "Elias Vance's art dealer and mentor. Shares a philosophical alignment with Elias regarding conceptual art, potentially inspiring or subtly encouraging his actions.",
      "initialStatementToPolice": "Upon learning of the incident after her return, Lena Petrova expressed surprise at the 'disappearance' of the drawing. She mused that, given Arthur Vance's curated collection and Elias's artistic leanings, it could almost be interpreted as an 'avant-garde performance piece' or a 'conceptual statement' by an unknown artist, specifically targeting Arthur's collection."

He recalled that the building's internal security system had a brief 'blip' on the monitor that night, but it self-corrected quickly and was logged as a minor system anomaly, which he didn't consider significant at the time."
