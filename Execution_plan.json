She creates a diversion by intentionally using an exotic, overpowering spice (Asafoetida) in the kitchen's air vent, which triggers the victim's smoke alarm and his allergies. While the victim is occupied dealing with the alarm and his coughing fit in the living room, she accesses his study and steals the coins from a known, but not obvious, hiding place.",
